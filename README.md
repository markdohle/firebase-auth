The next step is to set up email and password authentication for your application. Start by referencing Firebase and the Firebase authentication library within your login.html file, then add some code for the login page UI. Next, create a login.js file and configure the authentication process for the login page.

Finally, create a user and password, then log in to verify that authentication is working.
